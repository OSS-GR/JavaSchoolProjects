# Inventory

In this project, we practiced inheritance and abstract classes.

The Screen.java file contains the direct or indirect super class of the SmartTV,ComputerMonitor,LED and CRT classes. Each class represents a type of screen that is available in the inventory storage of a warehouse.

The Inventory.java file creates an inventory list based on the items entered. It rejects duplicate entries and provides methods to print a formated table of contents of the inventory alongside with their classification.

TestA4.java file contains the a test file written by my professor that allows us to test the implementation of the above classes.
