# Morse Code Converter

In this project, there are 3 files. The MorseCode.java contains a class object that stores a character and its equivalent string encoding consisting of "-" & ".".


The MorseCodeConvert.java file, utilizes the MorseCode class to create a list of instances of MorseCode from a file that contains the characters and string encodings seperated by a tab "\t". It also provides a method that prints the encoding list, a method that prints the equivalent of a string to Morse Code and a method that prints the translation of a text file to morse. This is all done printed back on the command line. The translated version is not written and saved into a new or existing file.

Lastly, TestMorseConverter.java is a file written by my professor that allows us to test the above methods and implementations.
